# Getting Started with React news app


I used three APIs from APIs that you gave to me such as Open News, Newyork times, and the Guardian 
From the three APIs I get images only from the Newyork  times API so I used static images for open news API and the Guardian apt

I made the system dockerized and here are the steps to run the system

Build the Docker image in the terminal using the command:
### `docker build -t news-front .`
Run the Docker container using the command:
### `docker run -p 3000:3000 news-front`.
